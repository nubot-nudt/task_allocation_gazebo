Welcome anyone to add somthing to this list or pick some items from it and contribute to this code.

1. Add a GUI to configure parameters, e.g. robot numbers, model path, etc. (medium)
2. Add a physical simulation model for kicking mechanism.  (hard)
3. Add a physical simulation model for dribble mechanism.  (hard) 
4. show role labels beside each robot; show the positioning points; (medium)
5. set up a virtule runtime environment; refer to Matlab's support for RoboCup; (hard)
7. Do not subscribe to the simulation information in the gazebo plugin; it is not necessary. (easy)
8. Try to get rid of installing gazebo_ros_pkgs; implement necessary parts in this package. (hard)
9. Try to run the simulation with/without GUI. (easy)
10. Get info about omni-directional movement from Youbot robot model
